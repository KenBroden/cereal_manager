;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DATA HANDLING~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;; load the data into a collection of hashmaps
(defn load-data
  "takes a file path to a .csv file -> returns a hashmap of the data"

          headers (map keyword (first rows))
          data (rest rows)]
      (map #(zipmap headers %) data))))

;; each map represents a row in the csv file
;; the keys are the column headers
;; the values are the data in each row

;; upside of this function: all data is in a single collection
;; downside: we are gonna be passing a bunch of data thru our 
;; functions which is not used at all. but having it promotes flexibility.

;; hashmap to use throughout the program

  (load-data "resources/cereal.csv"))
